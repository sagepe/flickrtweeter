Flickrtweeter
=============

This script is totally deprecated really, just put up here as a form of archive storage.

As described in the [original blog post](https://sgp.me.uk/2009/03/24/flickrtweeter/), it was designed to integrate Flickr and Twitter using bit.ly. It was made obsolete fairly quickly by better on-line integration between the tools.
